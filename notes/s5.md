# 5. Docker Compose with Multiple Local Containers

## TL;DR

[docker-compose.yml example](https://www.notion.so/Docker-and-Kubernetes-The-Complete-Guide-Stephen-Grider-cefe409e5fa5433e8881c3c02571bd8c?pvs=21)

```docker
# run the containers
docker-compose up

# (re)build and run the containers
docker-compose up --build

# run containers in background
docker-compose up -d

# stop all running containers
docker-compose down

# see status of running containers belonging to 
# docker-compose .yml file in current directory
docker-compose ps
```

## Application Overview

- Project: docker container that indicates the number of times someone has visited a website
    - **Node App**: host website
    - **Redis**: store number of visits
- Initial container architecture idea
    - Include Node App and Redis in a single container
    - Different Redis servers (on different containers) are complete out of sync
- Actual container architecture
    - Containers each have only a Node App
    - A single container talks to all containers (if it is scaled)

## App Server Starter Code

## Assembling a Dockerfile

- This Dockerfile is solely concerned with the NodeApp

```docker
FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR '/app'

COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . . 

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Introducing Docker Compose

- If we run our container (with only Node App) currently, we get an error
    
    —> we aren’t connected to a server
    
- How do we connect redis to our container?
    1. Use Docker CLI’s Network Features
        - **This is a real pain in the ass**
        
        —> you have to rerun commands everytime you startup container
        
        - Basically no one in industry does this
    2. Docker Compose (we’ll use this!)
- Docker Compose is a *separate CLI*
    1. Used to start up multiple Docker contaienrs at the same time
    2. Automates some of th elong-winded arguments we were passing to `docker run`

## Docker Compose Files

- Take the same commands we’re used to using and place them in **docker-compose.yml**
- docker-compose CLI parses **docker-compose.yml**
- **docker-compose.yml** can be complicated, these are basic steps
    1. Here are containers I want to create: x, y, …
    2. For each containers use “this” image (Dockerfile, DockerHub image)
    3. In addition, map the ports between these containers with Port a and Port b
- services - common word in docker loosely referring to containers
- **docker-compose.yml**
    
    ```docker
    # specify version of docker-compose
    version: '3'
    services: 
      # specify name of first container
      redis-server:
        # specify image and its source --> pulled from docker hub
        image: 'redis' # pulled from docker hub
      # specify name of second container
      node-app: 
        # specify image and its source --> built from dockerfile
        build: . 
        # specify ports
        ports: 
          # use "-" to specify an array in .yml files
          # <local-port>:<container-port>""
          - "4001:8081"
    ```
    

## Networking with Docker Compose

- By just using docker compose to create containers, they can exchange information freely
- **You don’t need to declare ports at all**
- How do we use this fact to connect our containers in code?
    - Change code in index.js file
    
    ```jsx
    const express = require('express'); 
    const redis = require('redis'); 
    
    const app = express(); 
    const client = redis.createClient({
    		// usually host is an http url to some server
        **host: 'redis-server'** // same name as our container, (docker compose knows how to deal with this)
    		port: 6379
    }); 
    client.set('visits', 0);
    
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        client.get('visits', (err, visits) => {
            res.send('Number of visits is ' + visits);
            client.set('visits', praseInt(visits) + 1)
        });
    });
    
    app.listen(8081, () => {
        console.log('Listening on port 8081');
    });
    ```
    

## Docker Compose Commands

- `docker-compose up` == `docker run <image-name>`
    - This only runs an already created image
- `docker-compose up --build` == `docker build .`  +  `docker run <image-name>`
    - This rebuilds an image and runs the image

## Stopping Docker Compose Containers

- `docker-compose up -d` - start containers in the background
- `docker-compose down` - stop all running containers

## Automatic Container Restarts

- Sometimes containers crash for various reasons
    - **Example: Forcing container to crash**
        
        ```jsx
        const express = require('express'); 
        const redis = require('redis'); 
        const process = require('process'); 
        
        const app = express(); 
        const client = redis.createClient({
            host: 'redis-server',
            port: 6379
        }); 
        client.set('visits', 0);
        
        app.get('/', (req, res) => {
            process.exit(0); ****// 0 indicates we exited because we wanted to --> everything is okay
            client.get('visits', (err, visits) => {
                res.send('Number of visits is ' + visits);
                client.set('visits', parseInt(visits) + 1)
            });
        });
        
        app.listen(8081, () => {
            console.log('Listening on port 8081');
        });
        ```
        
        - Notice: the redis container is still running but the node-app container is not running

## Restart Policies

1. “no” - never attempt to restart this . container if it stops or crashes
    - you must use quotes —> `no` is interpreted as `False` in .yml file (different from “no”)
2. always - if container stops *for any reason*, always attempt to restart it
    - Code Implementation
        
        ```docker
        # specify version of docker-compose
        version: '3'
        services: 
          # specify name of first container
          redis-server:
            # specify image and its source --> pulled from docker hub
            image: 'redis' # pulled from docker hub
          # specify name of second container
          node-app: 
            restart: always
            # specify image and its source --> built from dockerfile
            build: . 
            # specify ports
            ports: 
              # use "-" to specify an array in .yml files
              # <local-port>:<container-port>""
              - "4001:8081"
        ```
        
3. on-failure - only restart if the container stops with an error code
    - Error codes are any codes that aren’t 0
4. unless-stopped - always restart unless we (the developers) forcibly stop it
    - forcibly means “at the command line”
- You always want your web application to be available —> always restart policy

## Container Status with Docker Compose

- `docker-compose ps` - see status of running containers
