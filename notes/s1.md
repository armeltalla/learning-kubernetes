# 1. Dive Into Docker!

## **Finished Code and Diagrams**

**Finished Code**

Finished code is attached to each applicable lecture throughout the course. If you get stuck at any point you can download the code and compare it against yours with a diff tool like [Diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) or VSCode's built-in comparison tool.

**Diagrams**

The diagrams shown in the course are attached to this lecture note as a zip file.

- Download the file and extract it somewhere on your computer.
- Visit [diagrams.net (formerly draw.io)](https://www.diagrams.net/).
- Select **Open Existing Diagram** and use the file explorer to select the diagram file from your computer.
    
    or
    
- Click on **File** from the diagrams.net menu.
- Select **Open From Device** and use the file explorer to select the diagram file from your computer.

*Note - Please understand, if a diagram or group of diagrams is missing, this means that we no longer have them to share. You'll need to use a good browser screenshot extension tool such as [Awesome Screenshot](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/) to make a copy from the video lecture.*

## Why use Docker?

- Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies

## What is Docker?

- Docker - a platform or ecosystem around creating and running containers
    1. Docker Client 
    2. Docker Server
    3. Docker Machine
    4. Docker Images
    5. Docker Hub
    6. Docker Compose
- Image - single file with all the dependencies and configurations required to run a (specific) program
- Container - instance of an image; runs a program
- Local Docker Software
    - Docker Client = Docker CLI
        - issue commands through this
        - interact with through the terminal
    - Docker Server = Docker Daemon
        - tool responsible for creating images, running containers, etc.
        

## Using the Docker Client

- Check proper installation with `docker version`
        
- Run `docker run hello-world`

### Docker New Image Workflow

1. Run `docker run <image>` —> start up a new container from image `<image>`
    - Ex: docker run hello-world
2. Docker Client (CLI) is started
3. Docker Server receives directions from Docker CLI
    1. Check if `<image>` exists in the image cache (your local computer)
    2. Reach out to Docker Hub looking for image `<image>`
    3. Docker Server downloads `<image>` image from Docker Hub
    4. Docker Server loads `<image>` into memory —> created container 
    5. Docker runs the program inside `<image>`

## What’s a Container?

- Container - Runs an instance of an image

### Operating System Overview

- Kernel - governs access between programs running on your computer and the hardware on your computer
- System Call - running program issues request to kernel to interact with a piece of hardware
- Applications —> system call —> Kernel —> hard drive

### Example Problem

- **Problem**: Imagine you have two programs on your computer —> only Python v2 exists on hard drive (HD)
    1. Chrome - needs Python v2 (for some reason)
    2. NodeJS - needs Python v3 (for some reason)
- **Solution**: Namespacing - isolate resources per process (or group of processes)
    - Have both Python v2 and Python v3 on computer but direct the program (Chrome or NodeJS) to it’s proper application

### Terminology

- Namespacing - isolate resources per process (or group of processes)
    - Processes, Hard Drive, Network, Users, Hostnames, Inter Process Communication
- Control Groups (cgroups) - limit amount of resources used per process
    - Memory, CPU Usage, HD I/O, Network Bandwith
- The program (Chrome) makes a system call to the Kernel which directs hardware resources depending on the program and its grouping

### Containers and Images

- Contiainers are a set of processes that have a group of resources assigned to it
    - Not a physical container
- Image -
    1. a filesystem snapshot *AND*
    2. a startup command
- How is a container created from an image?
    - The file snapshot is placed into the containers associated resources (with nothing else available)
    - The startup comand is the executed
    

## How’s Docker Running on Your Computer?

- Namespacing and control groups is not included by default in all operating systems
- **Namespacing and control groups are specific to the Linux operating system**
- How does Docker interact with computers not using a Linux OS?
    - Docker installs a Linux Virtual Machine
    - Running processes —> Linux Kernel —> Linux Virtual Machinen —> MacOS/Windows —> Computer Hardware
