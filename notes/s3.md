# 3. Building Custom Images Through Docker Server

## TL;DR

```bash
# create a custom container with Dockerfile
docker build <directory-with-dockerfile>

# tag (name) an image
docker build -t <image-tag> <build-context-directory>

# tagging naming convention
<your-docker-id>/<repo/project-name>:<version>
	# version ":latest" is auto appended if you don't specify it
	Ex: stephengrider/redis

# to run an image using tag just specify <your-docker-id>/<repo/project-name> (not <version>)
Ex: docker run stephengrider/redis
```

## Creating Docker Images

********Workflow********

1. Create Dockerfile
    - Configuration to define how container should behave
2. Pass that to the Docker Client
3. Docker Client passes it to Docker Server
    - Does the heavy lifting for us
4. Image is created 

******Creating a Dockerfile******

1. Specify a base image
2. Run some commands to install additional programs
3. Specify a command to run on container startup

## Building a Dockerfile and Dockerfile Teardown

- Goal: Create an image that runs redis-server
- `docker build <directory-with-dockerfile>` - builds a custom dockerfile
- Dockerfile

```docker
# Use an existing docker image as a base
FROM alpine

# Download and isntall a dependency
RUN apk add --update redis

# Tell the image what to do when it starts
# as a container
CMD ["redis-server"]
```

- **FROM**, **RUN**, and **CMD** are instructions
    - Every line of a Dockerfile always begins with an instruction
    - There are plenty more instructions —> we’ll look at more throughout the course
- `alpine`, `apk add --update redis`, `[”redis-server”]` are arguments

## What’s a Base Image?

- Writing a dockerfile == being given a computer with no OS and being told to install Chrome
    - Loose analogy —> not perfect
- How do you install Chrome on a computer with no operating system?
    1. Install an OS —> install alpine base image
    2. Startup your default browser —> run a command
    3. Navigate to [chrome.google.com](http://chrome.google.com) —> run a command
    4. Download installer —> run a command
    5. Open file/folder explorer —> run a command
    6. Execute chrome_installer.exe —> run a command
    7. Execute chrome.exe —> command to run on startup
- Why did you use a specific base image? (Why did we use alpine?)
    - The default set of programs are very useful for us to begin with
    - **apk** (part of **alpine**) was useful to add **redis**

## The Build Process in Detail

- Why did we use `docker build`?
    - Takes a dockerfile and generates an image out of it
- The directory in which we place our dockerfile is the build context
- Every line of configuration in our dockerfile —> corresponds to a “step” during build
- `FROM alpine`
    1. Checked local build cache if we have **************alpine************** locally —> we didn’t
    2. Reached out to Docker Hub and downloaded alpine 
- `RUN apk add —-update redis`
    - Notice step 2 begins with **Running in <container-id>**
    - It then ends with **Removing intermediate container <container-id>**
- What’s going on here?
    1. It looked at `FROM alpine` and temporarily created a new container out of it
    2. `apk add --update redis` was run 
    3. —> **redis** and its dependencies were downloaded
    4. Same container has both **alpine** and **redis**
    5. Container is stopped
    6. Current file system snapshot is saved as an image (temporary)
- `CMD [”redis-server”]`
    1. Look at image from previous step —> create temporary container
    2. Container is told “redis-server” is the primary command
    3. Shuts down container
    4. Takes snapshot of filesystem and primary command
    5. *Saves everything as an image —> this is the actual image used to create other containers*
- Takeaway: Each step …
    1. Takes image from previous step
    2. Execute command from container or make change to filesystem
    3. Snapshot container and save as output for next instruction in the chain
    4. When no more instructions —> that final snapshot is the image used

## Brief Recap

- `FROM alpine`
    - Download alpine image
- `RUN apk add --update redis`
    1. Get image from previous step
    2. Create a container out of it —> Container!
    3. Run `apk add —update redis` in it —> Container! with modified filesystem
    4. Take snapshot of that container’s filesystem —> Filesystem snapshot
    5. Shut down that temporary container
    6. Get image ready for next instruction
- `CMD [”redis-server”]`
    1. Get image from previous step
    2. Create a container out of it —> Container!
    3. Tell container it should run redis-server when started —> Container! with modified primary command
    4. Shut down that temporary container
    5. Get image ready for next instruction
    - No more steps! —> Output is the image generated from previous step

## Rebuilds with Cache

- New dockerfile
    
    ```docker
    # Use an existing docker image as a base
    FROM alpine
    
    # Download and isntall a dependency
    RUN apk add --update redis
    RUN apk add --update gcc
    
    # Tell the image what to do when it starts
    # as a container
    CMD ["redis-server"]
    ```
    
- `FROM alpine`
    - Just uses the image we already have locally
- `RUN apk add --update redis`
    - Uses the build cache
- `RUN apk add --update gcc`
    - Brand new container is created since it senses a new step
- `CMD [”redis-server”]`
    - This command is the same but since the previous container is different, it must be rerun
- **Lesson: if you make a change to your dockerfile, everything is rebuild from that line on down**
    - The order does matter —> if you switch the order of installations, it will rebuild stuff from the first changed line on down
- **Practical Action: place the most unchangeable things at the top and the things most likely to change at the bottom**

## Tagging an Image

- `docker build -t <image-tag> <build-context-directory>`  - allows you to tag an image instead of using container id’s
- image-tag convention: `<your-docker-id>`/`<repo/project-name>`:`<version>`
    - **Example**: `stephengrider/redis:latest`
- When you run you only need to specify stephengrider/redis (not `:latest`) —> automatically runs latest
- Technically the version number is the tag
- Everything else is the repository/project name

## Note for Windows Users

In the upcoming lecture, we will be running a command to create a new image using docker commit with this command:

`docker commit -c 'CMD ["redis-server"]' CONTAINERID`

If you are a Windows user you may get an error like "**/bin/sh: [redis-server]: not found"** or **"No Such Container"**

Instead, try running the command like this:

`docker commit -c **"CMD 'redis-server'"** CONTAINERID`

## Manual Image Generation with Docker Commit

- Containers are created from images
- **Images can also be created from a container**
    1. Create a container
    2. Run a command
    3. Create new image
- **Example**
    
    ```bash
    # create container with alpine as base image
    # open a shell as soon as container is started
    docker run -it alpine sh
    
    # install redis into the container
    apk add --update redis
    
    # list running containers
    # use this to find container-id of the one we just created
    docker ps
    
    # create new container from running container
    docker commit -c 'CMD["redis-server"]' <container-id>
    
    # should output an image id like: sha256:db29c278a4c6f5d35df82a278fb95820370a455076dd33e90a26d8d45c268857
    # Thii
    ```
