# 2. Manipulating Containers with the Docker Client

---

## TL;DR

```bash
# creates and runs docker container 
# default file system and startup command
docker run <image-name>

# uses specified startup command
docker run <image-name> <command!>

# run the container in the background
docker run -d <image-name>

# list all running containers
docker ps

# list all containers stored on disk
docker ps --all

# create a container
docker create

# start a container
docker start <container-id>
# get output with start
docker start <container-id>

# remove all containers from disk 
docker system prune

# see the logs (output from a previously run container)
docker logs <container-id>

# stop a container (nicely)
docker stop <container-id>

# stop a container (forcefully)
docker kill <container-id> # you should use docker stop, not docker kill

# execute a command in a running container
docker exec -it <container-id> <command>

# open a command prompt for a running container
docker exec -it <container-id> sh
	# use Ctrl + C or Ctrl + D or "exit" to exit the shell

# immediately open a shell when running a container
docker run -it <image-name> sh
```

## Running an Image

- `docker run <image-name>` - creates and runs a docker container with the default file system and startup command from the docker image
- `docker run <image-name> <command!>`
    - runs a docker image with the specified `<command!>` instead of the default startup command
    - **Examples**
        - `docker run busybox echo hi there`
            - Output: *hi there*
        - `docker run busybox ls`
            - Outputs folders that are contained inside the image snapshot filesystem
            - Output
                
                bin
                dev
                etc
                home
                lib
                lib64
                proc
                root
                sys
                tmp
                usr
                var
                
        - `docker run hello-world ls`
            - Output: *docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: "ls": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.*
            - Doesn’t work because `ls` doesn’t exist in the hello-world image filesystem snapshot

## Listing Containers

- `docker ps` - lists all running containers
    - ps = “process status”
    - We need a container that runs for a longer time than `hello-world` or `busybox`
        
        —> `docker run busybox ping google.com`
        
        - pings [google.com](http://google.com) for awhile and measures latency
- NAMES are randomly generated
- `docker ps --all` - lists all containers currently stored on disk

## Container Lifecycle

- Creating a container - takes the filesystem snapshot and sets it up to be used on the computer
    - `docker create`
- Starting a container - executes the startup command
    - `docker start`
- `docker run` = `docker create` + `docker start`
    1. `docker create <image-name>`
    2. `docker start -a <container-id>`
        - need to use *-a* to tell docker to look for output from that container and display it in the terminal

## Restarting Stopped Containers

- Start a container that’s already been created with `docker start -a <container-id>`
    - You can find the `<container-id>` using `docker ps -all`
- You cannot replace the default command from a container you already started
    - It executes the command that was executed when created

## Removing Stopped Containers

- `docker system prune` - delete all the containers on local disk space
    - Also deletes stopped containers, networks not used by at least one container, dandling images, and build cache

## Retrieving Log Outputs

- `docker logs <container-id>` - gets the logs from a container
    - This does not rerun, recreate, or restart the container in any way

## Stopping Containers

- `docker stop <container-id>` - SIGTERM message is sent to the container to **shut down on its own time**
    - Allows for cleanup (save files, emit messages, etc.)
    - If container doesn’t shut down, `docker kill` is automatically run after 10 seconds
- `docker kill <container-id>` - SIGKILL message is sent to container to **shut down immediately**
- Use `docker stop` command (ideallly)

## Executing Commands in Running Containers

- `docker exec -it <container-id> <command>` - executes the *<command>* to the running container
    - `-it` allows us to provide input to the container
- **Example**: redis
    1. `docker run redis`
    2. Go to new terminal 
    3. `docker ps` 
    4. `docker exec -it <container-id> redis-cli`
    5. Use redis
        1. `set myvalue <value>`
        2. `get myvalue` (should return *<value>*)

## The Purpose of the IT Flag

- Reminder: **every docker container runs inside a linux machine**
    - If you have Mac or Windows, a linux virtual machine was installed with docker
    - Containers —> run on the linux virtual machine —> talks to your OS —> talks to your hardware —> etc.
- Every linux environment contains
    1. STDIN - standard in 
        - Stuff you type goes into STDIN
    2. STDOUT - standard out
        - Outputs are shown to you through STDOUT
    3. STDERR - standard error
        - Error outputs are show to you through STDERR
- `-it` is two separate flags —> `-i -t`
    - `-i` flag makes stuff you type routes to STDIN
    - `-t` flag makes the output print pretty to terminal (theres other stuff but that’s the basic effect)
- You can run `docker exec -i <container-id> <command>` to see what happens without `-t`

## Getting a Command Prompt in a Container

- `docker exec -it <container-id> sh` - opens a command prompt with typical Unix commands
    - To quit try `Ctrl + C`
    - If doesn’t work —> `Ctrl + D` —> “exit”
- `sh` - a command processor
    - Similar to `bash`, `powershell`, `zsh`

## Starting with a Shell

- `docker run -it <image-name> sh` - starts up a shell immediately when a container first starts
    - displaces the default command so beware of that
- **Example**
    - `docker run -it busybox sh`

## Container Isolation

- He just emphasizes container isolation
- Different containers have different file systems —> they are completely separate for all practical purposes
