# 4. Making Real Projects with Docker

## TL;DR

```docker
# port mapping
docker run -p <local-port>:<container-port> <image-name>
	Ex: docker run -p 8080:8080 bensmidt/simpleweb
```

- Uses cache to advantage

## Project Outline

- Goal: create tiny Node.js web application, wrap inside docker container, and access web application from a browser deployed on local machine
- Steps
    1. Create Node JS web app
    2. Create a Dockerfile
    3. Build image from dockerfile
    4. Run image as container
    5. Container to web app from a browser
- *We’re going to do some things slightly wrong*
    
    *—> we want to see mistakes and error message and how to fix them*
    

## Node Server Setup

### [Node Server Setup Code (zip file) - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OroifPRCJ7WCbJNZtGqLPmoLuHE_R8PQ/view?usp=share_link)

### Using Node JS

*The following commands assume* **npm** *is installed*

- `npm install`- installs dependencies specified in package.json
- `npm start` - starts the server

## Base Image Issues

- Dockerfile attempt 1

```docker
# Specify a base image
FROM alpine

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install 

# Default command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

- **Error**: `/bin/sh: npm: not found`
    - npm isn’t found in the container

### Option 1: Use the same image but install npm and node

### Option 2: Find a different base image (we’ll choose this one)

1. Navigate to docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/
2. Find Explore button (top bar)
3. Find node within these most used programs
- Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links shows different versions of node which you can install
    - Use these to specify your base image
    - **Example**: `FROM node:6.14` or `FROM node:14-alpine` (remember alpine is a tag in this case)
        - You must specify the 14-alpine version, otherwise you will see different errors, such as an idealTree error when attempting to build the image
- What does “alpine” mean?
    - alpine - term for an image that is as small and compact as possible
    - Default installation may include a lot of stuff —> alpine contains almost none of this stuff

## A Few Missing Files

- Dockerfile attempt 2
    - Base image issues are fixed

```docker
# Specify a base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install 

# Default command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

- **Error**: `npm WARN saveError ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/package.json’`
    - The container does not have a **package.json** file

## Copying Build Files

- `COPY <path-to-folder-to-copy-from-relative-to-build-context-directory> <path-to-copy-stuff-to-inside-container>`
    - This will copy code from your local machine into the container
- Dockerfile attempt 3
    - Base image issues are fixed
    - Missing file issues are fixed

```docker
# Specify a base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Install dependencies
COPY ./ ./
RUN npm install 

# Default command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

- Run the container with `docker run <image-tag>`
    - **Example**: docker run `bensmidt/simpleweb`
- **Error**: [localhost](http://localhost) refused to connect

## Container Port Mapping

- Recall the error: [localhost](http://localhost) refused to connect
- Why?
    - PORT 8080 default refers to your *local machine*
    - Containers have their own isolated set of PORTS
- We need to setup an explicit Port Mapping
- Port Mapping - forwarding a local port (8080) to the container

*The above content applies to information coming into the container. Containers can by default easily send information out*

- Port forwarding (mapping) isn’t specified in the Dockerfile —> specify when containers are started
- `docker run -p <local-port>:<container-port> <image-name>` - specifies port mapping
    - Example: `docker run -p 8080:8080 bensmidt/simpleweb`
- It works!

## Specifying a Working Directory

- You shouldn’t copy your files into the root directory —> may induce file conflicts
- `WORKDIR /path/to/folder` - specifies the working directory in which we want to run commands

```docker
# Specify a base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Specify working directory
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Install dependencies
COPY ./ ./
RUN npm install 

# Default command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Unnecessary Rebuilds

- If you edit files after you’ve built a container, the container does NOT update
- How do you get the updated code onto the container?
    - Completely rebuild the container
- This can be extremely wasteful —> docker must rebuild everything after the step of copying

## Minimizing Cache Busting and Rebuilds

- We’re going to split our `COPY` instruction into multiple steps
    - We want to only copy the **package.json** file so we can run **npm install**
        
        —> we always need the package.json file and it won’t change much; our source code may change a lot though
        
    - We’ll install everything else later

```docker
# Specify a base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Specify working directory
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Install dependencies
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install 
COPY ./ ./

# Default command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

- **Lesson: Dockerfile order instructions are very important**
